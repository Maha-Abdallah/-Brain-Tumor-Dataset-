# Brain Tumor Data Analysis and Visualization

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing brain tumor data, visualizing key insights, and providing descriptive statistics. While machine learning models were not used, we explore the datasetâ€™s characteristics and share valuable findings.

Key Features
Data Exploration: Investigate tumor types, patient ages, and gender distribution.
Correlation Analysis: Examine relationships between features.
Visualizations: Create informative plots (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps).
